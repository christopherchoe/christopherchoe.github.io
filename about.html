          <h4>Who Am I</h4>
          <br\>
            <p>
              I majored in biology and planned on pursuing dentistry but after life circumstances made me a full time
              caregiver,
              I grew to appreciate and enjoy programming enough to make the switch. Before the switch I owe a lot of my
              development to
              being a tutor. It made me proud to see the positive change I could make on someone by just magnifying the
              ability they
              already had. Due to the experiences I’ve had, I might end up overdoing it but tend to understand my
              limitations which
              included learning to ask for help sometimes. To help address my weaknesses, I chose to study at Holberton
              after completing
              my associates in computer science to help make me a better more well rounded software engineer.
              Motivation for me comes from the ability to sense my progress in tangible ways which is one reason I enjoy
              programming so
              much. Seeing code speed, cleanliness, documentation, etc. demonstrably improve as I learn and gain more
              experience motivates
              me to progress more and more. Along with that, I’ve learned from tutoring and my time at Holberton how
              important and enjoyable
              exchanging knowledge is to me. Working as a software engineer and being able to be a part of a team that can
              bounce ideas
              off each other and being willing to grow and hopefully help others grow is incredibly exciting for me.

          <p>
            My interests include music and sports. Unfortunately for both of these I'm much better at watching others do it than doing it myself.
            I am always open to talking about all types of music but have soft spots for R&B, soul, neo soul, hip hop, pop, rock, and funk. In terms
            of sports, my favorites are hockey, basketball and football but I have been known to watch anything including the oft Youtube recommended
            professional tag. I love my cat Hope and if you were to look through my phone you would probably find an embarassing amount of photos of her.
            Volunteering has also been something I like to do when I have the chance and have done so since middle school.
